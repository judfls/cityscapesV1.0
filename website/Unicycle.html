    My name is William and I’m seven and three-quarters years old. <br>
    My favorite food is hot dogs with ketchup, and my favorite<br>
     person used to be Uncle McAllister. He was my dad’s brother, <br>
     but everyone called him “Uncle McAllister” Like, even grownups.<br>
    I don’t really remember his voice exactly, but I remember he laughed<br>
     with his whole belly, even when it wasn’t Christmas. He always smelled<br>
      like old books, and once he gave me a rock and said it was from the moon.<br>
       I believed him because he had a telescope and knew the names of all the stars,<br>
        even the ones I couldn’t see.<br>
<br>

I think he was magic.<br>
<br>
But now he’s gone.<br>
<br>
Nobody really told me how it happened. When I asked my mom, she said, “It was just his time,” <br>
like he had an appointment or something. Dad just said, “He was a complicated man,” which I didn’t <br>
understand because he always made things simple for me.<br>
<br>
Sometimes I wonder if he’s actually still alive, just <a href="NotKentuckey.html">hiding somewhere secret.</a><br>
<br>
One day I’ll find out what really happened to him.<br>
<br>
But maybe… maybe I don’t want to know just yet.<br>
