Welcome! This is the landing page for NotKentuckey.HTML! You’ve found a quiet place, a pause in the noise,
 a space just a little outside the usual maps. Maybe that’s exactly what you needed.
There’s no pressure. No expectations. Just a sense of stillness and maybe a little wonder.
 You’re allowed to breathe here. To stay as long as you like.
You’re not in Kentuckey — but that’s not a bad thing. In fact, it might be the best thing that’s happened all day.
So rest, look around, and take your time. You’re welcome here. Always.
