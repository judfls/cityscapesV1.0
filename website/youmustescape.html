        <h3><i>Dear “Uncle” McAllister,</i></h3><br>
        <i>
          By now, you’ve noticed the cold tile against your skin and the stale, metallic <br>
          taste in your mouth. Welcome to your new home. Fitting, really. You always <br>
          struck me as someone who tried to keep things clean. Let's see how tidy your <br>
          mind stays under pressure.<br><br>

          You’ve been so very difficult to get alone, Mr. McAllister. Always locked doors, <br>
          always lights on, always someone watching. But not anymore. Now it’s just <br>
          you, me, and the quiet drip of that leaky pipe you’ll learn to hate. I’ve left you <br>
          some clues, little breadcrumbs to earn your freedom. Think of it as a <br>
          game—one you must win. <br><br>

          If you solve the puzzle, you get to walk out. If not, well… I suppose the flies <br>
          will find you eventually. They always do. Try not to scream. The walls are <br>
          thick, and the only ears that listen in here are mine. You have until the lights <br>
          go out again. After that, it’s just the dark—and me.<br><br>

          Looking forward to seeing how smart you really are,<br><br>
